# Brazilian-E-Commerce

The objective of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis of the Brazilian e-commerce public database provided by Olist. The goal was to gain valuable insights into various facets of the e-commerce landscape and to present these findings through compelling visualizations. I used SQL to explore, manipulate, and analyze the database to discover trends, patterns and relationships within the data. Utilized Tableau to create an informative dashboard with visualizations that illustrate findings and communicate insights effectively.
