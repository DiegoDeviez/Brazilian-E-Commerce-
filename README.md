# Brazilian-E-Commerce

The objective of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis of the Brazilian e-commerce public database provided by Olist. The goal was to gain valuable insights into various facets of the e-commerce landscape and to present these findings through compelling visualizations. I used SQL to explore, manipulate, and analyze the database to discover trends, patterns and relationships within the data. Utilized Tableau to create an informative dashboard with visualizations that illustrate findings and communicate insights effectively.

Dataset Information
The dataset for this project was sourced from Olist, a well-known Brazilian e-commerce platform. I would like to give credit to Olist for providing this comprehensive dataset, which includes a variety of information crucial for analysis. The dataset columns are as follows:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Order Status: Status of the order (e.g., delivered, canceled).
Order Purchase Timestamp: Date and time when the order was placed.
Order Approved Timestamp: Date and time when the order was approved.
Order Delivered Carrier Date: Date when the order was delivered to the carrier.
Order Delivered Customer Date: Date when the order was delivered to the customer.
Order Estimated Delivery Date: Estimated delivery date of the order.
Product ID: Unique identifier for each product.
Seller ID: Unique identifier for each seller.
Price: Price of the product.
Freight Value: Freight cost for the order.
Payment Type: Method of payment (e.g., credit card, voucher).
Payment Installments: Number of payment installments.

The main questions I aimed to solve using the data were:

What are the key sales trends over time in the Brazilian e-commerce market?
Which product categories perform the best in terms of sales?
